This example shows how an attacker who is a member of docker group can become root on host and commit privileged actions - attacks. Here the attacker creates a file in root's /etc/ directory just to show that he has write access everywhere.

1. ./1_run_attacker.sh: Start the container
2. ./2_attack_inside_the_container.sh: Change /bin/sh's ownership and permissions. Since it is mounted, the changes are done directly to the host
3. ./3_run_shell.sh: Run ./sh in /bin/ to get in a shell on host. The attacker will get in it as root because of +s permission.
4. ./4_attack_inside_shell.sh: Commit the attack whatever this is... Here just create a file in host's /etc/
5. ./5_ll_on_host.sh: ll /etc/ | grep Hello --> Check file's ownership
6. ./clear.sh: Delete file in /etc/
