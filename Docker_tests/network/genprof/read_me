Trying to see if genprof will give me the same profile I got from my system.
To do so we run aa-genprof with a script that runs the container and we allow everything it asks.
The profile we got was quite similar except for some rules that are included because we ran a bash script, docker deamon etc which in my system are excluded since we aim only to container constraints.
The main difference is that genprof does not give us rule file which is essential for the container to run.
