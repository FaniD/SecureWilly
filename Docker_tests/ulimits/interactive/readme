Steps:
0. Run script set_profile.sh
1. Run script run.sh #terminal 1
2. From another terminal run script new_terminal.sh #terminal 2
3. #terminal 2: Run script check_nproc.sh
4. #terminal 1: Run exec test

It should stop at nproc < 512 due to AppArmor profile.

It works when running as user.
Not working when running as root -> root seems to increase hard limit automatically.
