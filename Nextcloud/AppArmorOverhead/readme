The profiles in this directory have slight differences from the profiles used in the previous instance of Nextcloud due to system changes - networking on containers may change from one machine to another.

Profiles under this directory were generated on Ubuntu 18.10.

In order to produce the results on time of overhead, we executed the following scripts:

1. ./unconfined.sh
2. ./overhead.sh
