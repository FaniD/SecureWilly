Timer info can be found looking for timer_now()

Parameters for figuring out if a connection should be counted:

1. test_time_start - global for start of expt.
2. s->basic.time_connect_start - time that session (connection?) started
3. param.wsesslog.num_sessions - number of sessions from command line
4. param.timeout - command line argument
5. param.rate.rate_param - command line argument (--rate)

expt_length = param.wsesslog.num_sessions / param.rate.rate_param
check if expt_length > 2 * timeout!

steady_state_start = test_time_start + timeout
steady_state_end = test_time_start + expt_length - timeout

HOW TO:
1. initialize steady_state_start and end
2. when a connection starts, check against steady_state_start & end, and set flag accordingly.
3. When statistics are counted/accumulated, check flag for which stats to produce.

stats stuff is all in stats/basic.c?
