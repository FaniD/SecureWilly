Working on code Adam did for
handling headers (including range requests).

Think about making this code selectable via --with or --without
options.

Added stuff to use an increased number of open files.
The "include" directory has new definitions for __FD_SETSIZE.
This is used in the Makefile.in where -DBIG_FD_SETSIZE is set.
