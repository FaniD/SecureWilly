- Long term: add ability to specify start_conn_num and end_conn_num
  for stable stats (so this works without wsesslog).
- Test compiled and ./httperf 
MAC OS X
Linux Ubuntu 12.04
Linux (old Redhat version on rocket)
  ../configure
  ../configure --enable-debug 

- Clean up lots of warnings and at some point turn on -Wall -Werror

- Talk to Tyler about what the code is doing that generates these
  warnings and clean up that code.
  ../../stat/call_stats.c:315: warning: operation on 'i' may be undefined


- Need man page info for --calls-stats
- Need man page info for --ramp-up-num-conns
- Need man page info for --ramp-down-num-conns
- Need man page info for --stagger-start
- Need man page info for --spec-stats

- *** Check if SSL/HTTPS can be specified in wsesslog and if it works

- check fpsetmask(0) on FreeBSD

- Modify Makefile.in to do the right stuff
- Possibly Makefile.uwinc

- Test the SSL case

- Is HAVE_SCHED_AFFINITY off by default (it should be)
- Integrate _HAVE_EPOLL HASVE_SCHED_AFFINITY, etc. into configure
- Cleanup #ifdef OLDWAY


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Some ideas (contributions/patches welcome):

- wsesspage: don't fetch same object more than once (assume the existence
  of a cache)---this avoids trouble with recursive pages
- make httperf easier to use; some ideas:
	o Make httperf into a network daemon that is controlled by
	  an httperf frontend.  This would allow running tests with
	  a single command line even when multiple clients are involved.
	  The performance results should be reported both on a
	  per-client basis and in a summarized form reporting overall
	  server behavior.
	o Provide (default) scripts to run certain benchmarks.
	o Provide (default) scripts to produce performance graphs.
- use cycle registers to get time on CPUs that have such registers
  (IA-64, PA-RISC, x86, Alpha, at least)
- randomize the uri's generated by --wset so we can defeat file prefetching
  that the server (or the server's OS) may attempt to do

Done:

+ Specifying --session-cookie without specifying a session workload causes
  httperf to core-dump (reported by Dick Carter, 10/13/98)
+ elevate `Session' to same level as Call and Connection
+ sample session throughput when using sessions (not just rate throughput)
+ integrate Dick's wsesslog
+ write man-page
+ chunked replies fail after the first reply (at least on HP-UX)
+ core.c does not fully support pipelined requests yet; would require
  changes to the watchdog management
